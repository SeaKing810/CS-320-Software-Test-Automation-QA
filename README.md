## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code is functional and secure?

I ensure functionality by aligning every requirement to a unit test. I use positive and negative testing, boundary analysis, and strict input validation. Security begins with defensive programming, proper validation, and preventing invalid object states.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I translate requirements into validation rules and test cases. Each user requirement becomes both implementation logic and a verification test to ensure traceability.

### How do I approach designing software?

I analyze requirements first, design simple and focused classes, enforce validation at construction, and build comprehensive unit tests. I prioritize clarity, maintainability, and testability throughout development.
