## Summary of Unit Testing Approach

In Project One, I developed backend services for managing contacts. My testing approach was requirement-driven. Each documented constraint was translated directly into validation logic and corresponding unit tests.

I implemented positive and negative testing to verify proper functionality and proper exception handling. Boundary value analysis was used to test field length limits and required data constraints.

## Testing Techniques Used

- Unit testing with JUnit  
- Boundary value analysis  
- Equivalence partitioning  
- Exception testing  
- Defensive programming  

## Testing Techniques Not Used

This project did not include integration testing, system testing, or CI/CD automation. In a production environment, these additional testing layers would be critical to ensure full system reliability.

## Reflection

This project reinforced the importance of aligning implementation with requirements. Writing unit tests improved the quality of my code by forcing me to consider edge cases and failure scenarios before deployment. Automated testing ensures long-term maintainability and reduces regression risk.
